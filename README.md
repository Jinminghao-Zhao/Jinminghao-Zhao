Hi, I'm Jinminghao Zhao, but you can call me Jin for short!

I'm very interested in not completely failing my Computer Science courses, but besides that I'm interested in coding (obviously) and learning Japanese! Right now, I prefer to code in Python :snake: and C.

I am getting used to Github, so I don't know if I'll be of much help, but I'm open to anything and everything! :tada:
 
ðŸ“« How to reach me, in case you decide to want to reach out to me for whatever reason, my email jinminghaozhao@gmail.com works!
